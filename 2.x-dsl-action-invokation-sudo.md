    Capistrano::Configuration::Actions::Invocation

The `sudo` action is used to execute commands via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo sudo]. It can be used in either of two ways (although one is deprecated). Although you could use sudo directly in your `run()` invocations, this helper makes it possible for Capistrano to prompt you for the sudo password when the remote server(s) prompt for it.
