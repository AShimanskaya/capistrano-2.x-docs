    Capistrano::Configuration::Actions::Invocation

The `sudo` action is used to execute commands via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo sudo]. It can be used in either of two ways (although one is deprecated). Although you could use sudo directly in your `run()` invocations, this helper makes it possible for Capistrano to prompt you for the sudo password when the remote server(s) prompt for it.

## `sudo(options={})`

This use of sudo does not actually execute anything. Instead, it returns a string containing the sudo command to execute. This lets you embed it in commands invoked via <tt>[[run]]</tt>, which in turn lets you build arbitrarily complex commands that use sudo.

    run "#{sudo} apachectl restart"
    run "#{sudo :as => 'bob'} crontab -l"
    run "cd /u/apps/social && #{sudo} script/restart"
    run "if [ ! -d /u/apps ]; then #{sudo} mkdir -p /u/apps; fi"
