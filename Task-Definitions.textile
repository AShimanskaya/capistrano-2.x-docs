The simplest capistrano task would look like this, note there is nothing happening remotely here:

<pre>
desc "Print out the local time on the system"
task :time do
  puts Time.now.to_s
end
</pre>

In order to perform a similar action on a remote machine, assuming you have [[everything properly configured]], the same task might look something like this:

<pre>
set :server_ruby, '/opt/local/bin/ruby' 
desc "Print out the time on the remote servers"
task :remote_time, :roles => :app do
  puts capture("#{ruby} -e 'puts Time.now.to_s'")
end
</pre>
