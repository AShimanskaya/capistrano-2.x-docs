The default execution path is how I refer to what happens when you type `cap deploy` or, more accurately `cap deploy:setup` than `cap deploy`.

As youÂ can also imagine, this does not account for any *before* or *after* hooks you may have added.

If you do not want to use this default strategy, designed for Rails applications, please see alternate deployment recipes.
