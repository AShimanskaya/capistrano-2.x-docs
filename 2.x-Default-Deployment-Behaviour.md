The default execution path is how I refer to what happens when you type "cap deploy" or, more accurately "cap deploy:setup" then "cap deploy"

As you may also imagine, this does not account for any before or after hooks you may have added.

Update: The files are available for you to fork on GitHub, please feel free to contribute or edit them, there is a PNG and a PDF, as well as an OmniGraffle format master file.

If you do not want to use this default strategy, designed for Rails applications, please see alternate deployment recipes.
