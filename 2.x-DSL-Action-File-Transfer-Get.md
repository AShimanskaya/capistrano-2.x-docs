**Definition**

    get(remote_path, path, options={}, &block) 

**Module**

    Capistrano::Configuration::Actions::FileTransfer 

The get action is used to transfer files (or even an entire directory tree) from a single remote host to the local host. It is identical the download helper, invoked with the `:once` option:

    get "/etc/hosts", "downloads/hosts"
    download "/etc/hosts", "downloads/hosts", :once => true

Refer to `download()` for the full scoop of what's possible.
