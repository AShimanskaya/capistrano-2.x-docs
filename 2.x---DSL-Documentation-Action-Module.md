There are several helper methods that Capistrano provides for you to use in your recipes. These helpers vary in purpose from executing commands, to transferring files, to manipulating the output of a command:

## Invocation

* `run` Execute commands on one or more servers
* `sudo` (**Deprecated**) Execute commands on one or more servers via sudo.
* `parallel` Execute multiple commands on multiple servers in parallel

## Inspection

## File Transfer

The file-transfer actions all use either `scp` or `sftp` to move files to or from the remote hosts.

* [[`put`]] Store the contents of a file on multiple servers.
* `get` Transfers a file from a single remote server to the local host.
* `upload` Transfers a file or directory from the local host to multiple remote hosts, in parallel.
* `download` Transfers a file or directory from multiple remote hosts to the local host, in parallel.
