**Definition**

    task(name, options={}, &block)

**Module**

    Capistrano::Configuration::Namespaces

Tasks are the fundamental unit of work in Capistrano. With the task method, you can declare certain actions to be taken against some set of servers. You can also invoke other tasks.

## Arguments

### name

This should be a symbol naming the task. The name should include only letters, numbers, and the underscore character; using other characters in task names may make it difficult to invoke the task from other tasks.

## options

When declaring a task, you can specify any of the options that `run` accepts. Additionally, you can specify:

* `:desc` A string describing the task. This is typically provided via the desc method, but sometimes it is more convenient to pass it as an option.
* `:on_error` This **must** be a symbol, or `nil`. If a symbol, it must be either `:continue`, or `:abort`. If `nil`, it defaults to `:abort`. If this value is `:abort`, then a command that fails within the task will cause Capistrano to abort processing at this task. If it is `:continue`, then a command that fails within the task will allow Capistrano to proceed, despite the failure.

Note that, of the additional options that run provides, typically you'll only use :roles, :only, or :except with task. However, you are free to use any of them if you need them.

## &block

A block must be given; it defines the body of the task. Within the body of a task, you'll typically make use of `run`, `transaction`, `on_rollback`, and so forth. You can also invoke other tasks, either via `find_and_execute_task`, or by invoking the task directly, as if it were a method.

## Examples

    task :restart, :roles => [:web, :app] do
      parallel do |session|
        session.when "in?(:web)", "#{sudo} apachectl restart"
        session.when "in?(:app)", "#{sudo} restart_mongrel"
      end
    end

    task :deploy do
      transaction do
        update_code
        symlink
      end

      restart
    end

    task :backup_database, :roles => :db, :only => { :backup => true } do
      run "#{sudo} mysqldump ... > /tmp/backup.sql"
      run "#{sudo} bzip2 /tmp/backup.sql"
      run "scp /tmp/backup.sql.bz2 offsite.host:/u/backups"
      run "#{sudo} rm /tmp/backup.sql.bz2"
    end

    namespace :apache do
      [:stop, :start, :restart, :reload].each do |action|
        desc "#{action.to_s} server"
        task action, :roles => :web do
          run "apachectl -f /usr/apache2/conf/httpd.conf -k #{action.to_s}"
        end
      end
    end
