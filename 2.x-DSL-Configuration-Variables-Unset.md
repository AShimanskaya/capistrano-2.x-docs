**Definition**

    unset(name) 

**Module**

    Capistrano::Configuration::Variables 

This method allows you to remove a variable from Capistrano's knowledge. Note that this is different from setting a variable to nil; if the variable is nil, Capistrano still knows about it (e.g. `exists?` will still return true). Calling unset, though, will purge the variable from Capistrano altogether.

    set :moonboots, :awesome
    puts exists?(:moonboots)     #--> prints "true"
    set :moonboots, nil
    puts exists?(:moonboots)     #--> prints "true"
    unset :moonboots
    puts exists?(:moonboots)     #--> prints "false"

## Arguments

### name

This should be the name of a variable that Capistrano knows about. However, if the variable is unknown to Capistrano, the method will simply do nothing, so it is not dangerous to call with any given argument.
