**Definition**

    Transaction (&block) 

**Module**

    Capistrano::Configuration::Execution 

Invoke a set of tasks in a transaction within a task. If any task fails (raises an exception), all tasks executed within the transaction are inspected to see if they have an associated on_rollback hook, and if so, that hook is called.

    transaction do
      update_code
      symlink
    end
