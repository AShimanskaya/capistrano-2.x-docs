Multistage is an easy way to write your deployment script for multiple environments. Typically you might have a development, testing and production environment. The deployment strategy values might differ ever so slightly between these different environments(stages) and you don't want to write the same task 3 times over for each environment. Another typical usage might be to deploy different `applications/code/<whatever you're deploying>` to the same set of servers.

Note: This wiki article will assume you are starting from scratch as this makes it easier to explain and give examples.

## Installation

Capistrano Multistage ships in its own gem, install with:

    # gem install capistrano-ext

Secondly create a sandpit directory:

    $ mkdir -p tms/config/deploy

**tms stands for "Test Multi-Stage"**

The config and deploy directories is the directory structure expected by Capistrano and will be required if you want your deployment to work without any further modifications.

Edit `tms/capfile` and add the following two lines:

    set :stages, %w(dev prod)
    require 'capistrano/ext/multistage'

The first line will set two stages called dev and prod. This can be more dynamic but more on that later. the second line one would hope is kind of self explanatory...

The author always use the following task to do testing with but you are free to add any testing task that you might prefer.

    task :uname do
      run "uname -a"
    end

That takes care of your main config file. Capistrano will now expect two files called `dev.rb` and `prod.rb` to exist in the `tms/config/deploy` directory.

Create these files and add a role definition in each such as:

`dev.rb`

    role :appservers, "devserver1", "devserver1"

`prod.rb`

    role :appservers, "appserver1", "appserver2"

That should be it. If you now run `cap uname` you will get the following message:

No stage specified. Please specify one of: `dev`, `prod` (e.g. `cap dev uname')

Following the instructions in the message, if you run

    cap dev uname 

or

    cap prod uname

you will see your task being executed only for the stage that you specified.

Optionally you can also add the following line which will automatically deploy to the default stage specified.

    set :default_stage, "dev"

## Caveats

Try not to name your stage `stage` - this causes a name conflict error with a reserved word in the extension and can cause an infinite loop. (And won't deploy anything.)
