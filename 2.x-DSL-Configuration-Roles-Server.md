**Definition**

    server(host, *roles, attributes={}) 

**Module**

    Capistrano::Configuration::Roles 

Like the `role` method, this is another way to associate a server with role. However, where as the role method takes a single role and associates (potentially) many servers with it, the server helper takes a single server and associates (potentially) many roles with it.

*This is particularly handy if you are working in an environment with very few servers, and the servers fulfill multiple roles.* (For example: deploying a web application to a single host, where the single host is both the web server, application server, and database server.) 

## Arguments

### host

This is the name of the host, and has the same syntax and semantics as an individual element of the `*servers` parameter to role. 

### *roles

This should be a list of symbols identifying the names of the roles to associate the server with. Typical role names are things like :app, :web, :db, or :mail; choose a name that makes sense for your configuration. If you use the same name in a subsequent `server` or `role` invocation, the second invocation will add to the prior one. 

### attributes

This has the same syntax and semantics as the attributes parameter of the `role` method. The same attributes will apply this server in every role referenced in this declaration. (Different servers, or the same server in a different declaration, will not reuse these attributes.) 

## Example

    server "social.com", :web, :app, :db
