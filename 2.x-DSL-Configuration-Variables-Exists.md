    Capistrano::Configuration::Variables 

This method returns true if the given variable has been set, and false otherwise. It can be useful for determining whether a variable has already been set before setting a default (such as would be the case if the variable were set on the command-line).

    set :user, ENV['USER'] unless exists?(:user)
    set(:revision) { query_revision } unless exists?(:revision)

## Arguments
