Capistrano's configuration is managed through a set of magic variables. Some only take effect under certain circumstances, and others will affect all operations.

Please see the table below for more information:

|^. <code>:application     </code> | Arbitrary variable, useful to store your application name within. |
|^. <code>:user            </code> | The SSH username you are logging into the server(s) as. In collaborative development, you might not want to embed your own username here, since other developers might be deploying, too. [[Using SSH Keys]] is recommended. |
|^. <code>:password        </code> | The SSH password you are logging into the server(s) with. It should be the password that matches the :user variable. It is generally not a good idea to hard-code this variable into the file, except while you are first getting familiar with Capistrano. It is much better idea to setup SSH public/private keys - in which case this variable does not need to be set at all. Again [[Using SSH Keys]] is recommended. |
|^. <code>:scm             </code> | For specifying the type of source control system you are using. It is set to `git` by default. It is unnecessary to set it explicitly unless you are using something else. See the [[Source Control]] section for more info. |
|^. <code>:scm_username    </code> | The username that your [[Source Control]] system will use to access the repository. |
|^. <code>:scm_password    </code> | The password that your source control system (for ex: subversion) will use to access the repository. It is generally not a good idea to hard-code this variable into the file, except while you are first getting familiar with Capistrano. It is a better idea to investigate [[Using SSH Keys]]. Where [[Using SSH Keys]] is not an option [[SCM Credential Caching]] might be appropriate. |
|^. <code>:repository      </code> | The URL of the repository that hosts our code for example <code>http://github.com/capistrano/capistrano.git</code> or <code>git@github.com/capistrano/capistrano.git</code>. If you are hosting the repository on your own. |
|^. <code>:local_repository</code> | The repository URL that should be used when querying from the your workstation. If this is set, <code>:repository</code>, becomes the URL that should be used when querying the repository from the remote hosts. *This is handy when your accessing the repository via different methods locally vs. remotely:* <pre>set :repository, "file:///var/svn/repos/my_app" set :local_repository, "svn+ssh://#{user}@servername.com/var/svn/repos/my_app"</pre> |
|^. <code>:deploy_to       </code> | The path on the servers we're going to be deploying the application to. For example <code>/var/www/my-application</code>. The default is <code>/u/apps/</code>. |
