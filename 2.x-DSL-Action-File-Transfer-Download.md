**Definition**
    download(from, to, options={}, &block) 
**Module**
    Capistrano::Configuration::Actions::FileTransfer 

The `download` action is used to transfer files (or even entire directory trees, though that'll be slow) from (potentially multiple) remote hosts to the local host, in parallel. It may be configured to use either SFTP or SCP to copy the files, defaulting to SFTP.

Note that because this helper uses the SCP and SFTP protocols, it isn't possible to "sudo". You need to make sure that the user you are logging into the server(s) as has the necessary permissions to read the files.

## Arguments

### from

This must be a string indicating the path on the remote server that should be downloaded from. It may include the string $CAPISTRANO:HOST$, which will be replaced with the actual host name when the file is downloaded.

    download("/etc/hosts", ...)
    download("/usr/local/nginx/conf/server-$CAPISTRANO:HOST$.conf", ...)

### to

This is a string identifying a file or directory name on the local host that you want to download the data to. It may include the special string `$CAPISTRANO:HOST$`, which will be replaced with the actual host name of the server being downloaded from. In fact, if you are downloading from multiple hosts simultaneously, you almost have to use $CAPISTRANO:HOST$ is the destination name, otherwise the servers will all be writing to the same file and you'll get a mess (if it works at all). By including the host name in the destination file, you can download each server's version of the file to a separate file locally.

    download("/etc/hosts", "downloads/hosts-$CAPISTRANO:HOST$")

### options

The options hash can be used to modify the default behavior of download. Recognized options are: 

* `:mode` This should a string indicating the desired permissions of the destination file or directory, after it is downloaded. Permissions are changed via a separate call to chmod, so any valid argument to chmod will work (either octal numbers or symbolic permissions). 
* `:via` This is a symbol indicating which protocol should be used to transfer the file or directory. If given, it must be either :sftp (the default), or :scp. 
* `:hosts` Either a string (for a single target host) or an array of strings, indicating which hosts should be downloaded to. By default, the hosts are determined from current task's roles. 
* `:roles` Either a string or symbol (for a single target role) or an array of strings or symbols, indicating which roles should be downloaded to. If :hosts is specified, :roles will be ignored. By default, the roles are taken from the current task. 
* `:only` Specifies a condition limiting which hosts will be selected to receive the download. This should refer to values set in the role. For example, if a role is defined with :primary => true, then you could select only hosts with that setting by specifying :only => { :primary => true }. 
* `:except` Specifies a condition limiting which hosts will be selected to receive the download. This is the inverse of :only (hosts that do not match the condition will be selected). 
* `:once` If true, only the first matching server will be selected. The default is false (all matching servers will be selected). 
* `:max_hosts`     Specifies the maximum number of hosts that should be selected at a time. If this value is less than the number of hosts that are selected to receive the download, then the hosts will be downloaded to in groups of max_hosts. The default is nil, which indicates that there is no maximum host limit. **Warning: this setting will probably be removed in a future release.**

Note that the options are also passed directly through to the `Net::SFTP` (for `:sftp`) and `Net::SCP` (for `:scp`) libraries. Options exposed by those libraries are documented in those libraries. (For `SFTP`, see the `Net::SFTP::Operations::download` module. For `SCP`, see the `Net::SCP#download` method.)
