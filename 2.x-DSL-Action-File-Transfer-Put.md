**Definition**

    put(data, path, options={}) 

**Module**

    Capistrano::Configuration::Actions::FileTransfer 

The put action is `upload`'s little brother. Rather than uploading from a file (or directory) locally, it takes a string and uploads that as the contents of a file on the remote servers. This lets you upload generated content without having to write it to a file locally, first.

## Arguments

### data

This is a string containing the contents of the file you want to upload.

### path

This is a string naming the file on the remote server(s) that should be created (or overwritten) with the given data. It may include the string `$CAPISTRANO:HOST$`, which will be replaced with the actual host name when the file is uploaded.

### options

The options hash can be used to modify the default behavior of put. Recognized options are: 

#### `:mode`

This should a string indicating the desired permissions of the destination file or directory, after it is uploaded. Permissions are changed via a separate call to chmod, so any valid argument to chmod will work (either octal numbers or symbolic permissions). 

#### `:via`

This is a symbol indicating which protocol should be used to transfer the file or directory. If given, it must be either `:sftp` (the default), or `:scp`. 

#### `:hosts`

Either a string (for a single target host) or an array of strings, indicating which hosts should be uploaded to. By default, the hosts are determined from current task's roles. 

#### `:roles`

Either a string or symbol (for a single target role) or an array of strings or symbols, indicating which roles should be uploaded to. If `:hosts` is specified, :roles will be ignored. By default, the roles are taken from the current task. 

#### `:only`

Specifies a condition limiting which hosts will be selected to receive the upload. This should refer to values set in the role. For example, if a role is defined with :primary => true, then you could select only hosts with that setting by specifying `:only => { :primary => true }`. 

#### `:except`

Specifies a condition limiting which hosts will be selected to receive the upload. This is the inverse of `:only` (hosts that do not match the condition will be selected). 

#### `:once`

If true, only the first matching server will be selected. The default is false (all matching servers will be selected). 

#### `:max_hosts`

Specifies the maximum number of hosts that should be selected at a time. If this value is less than the number of hosts that are selected to receive the upload, then the hosts will be uploaded to in groups of `max_hosts`. The default is nil, which indicates that there is no maximum host limit. 

**Warning: this setting will probably be removed in a future release.**

Note that the options are also passed directly through to the `Net::SFTP` (for :sftp) and `Net::SCP` (for :scp) libraries. Options exposed by those libraries are documented in those libraries. (For `SFTP`, see the `Net::SFTP::Operations::Upload` module. For `SCP`, see the `Net::SCP#upload` method.) 

## Examples

For example, suppose you wanted to generate a Rails database configuration file in-memory. Since it's just a YAML file, you can easily create the configuration as a Ruby Hash object, and convert it to YAML and upload it, like this: 

    config = { "adapter"  => "mysql",
               "database" => "social_prod",
               "host"     => "db.social",
               "username" => "social",
               "password" => "social-password" }
    put config.to_yaml, "/u/apps/social/current/config/database.yml"

Another common use for the put helper is to generate something from an (e.g.) ERB template, to upload. To use Rails again as an example, suppose you want to upload a maintenance.html page to display while you do some scheduled maintenance on your web app: 

    require 'erb'
    reason = ENV['REASON']
    until = ENV['UNTIL']
    html = ERB.new(File.read("maintenance.rhtml")).result(binding)
    put html, "/u/apps/social/current/public/maintenance.html"
