There are several helper methods that Capistrano provides for you to use in your recipes. These helpers vary in purpose from executing commands, to transferring files, to manipulating the output of a command:

### Roles

### Tasks & Namespaces

### Variables

Variables can be transparently referenced (though not assigned) in a Capistrano recipe file or task, simply by referencing them as if they were a local variable. Note, though, that to set a Capistrano variable you must resort to the `set()` method. See also [[Configuration Variables|2.x---Significant-Configuration-Variables]].

* `set()` Associates a value with a variable. ([[more...]])
* `unset()` Deletes a variable.  ([[more...]])
* `exists?()` Queries whether a variable has been set.  ([[more...]])
* `fetch()` Returns the value of a variable, or a default value if the variable has not been set.  ([[more...]])

### Execution

* `transaction()` Begin a transaction, within which errors may trigger on_rollback clauses. ([[more...]])
* `on_rollback()` Specify code to be executed if an exception is raised within a transaction block.  ([[more...]])
* `current_task()` Return a reference to the task that is currently being executed. ([[more...]])
* `find_and_execute_task` Execute a specified task at fully-qualified path. ([[more...]])
