When beginning with Capistrano, it's often difficult for people to visualise how all the gears fit together.

Capistrano is a system for *intermediate-to-advanced programmers* to execute commands in a structured, repeatable way on one or more remote machines.

*It is incidentally pre-configured for deploying Rails applications.*

Successful use of Capistrano depends on a working knowledge of:

* SSH (With configured ["SSK Keys":using-ssh-keys])
* Ruby
* Rake (in, that we follow their structure of [[task definitions]])
* Source control software
