When beginning with Capistrano, it's often difficult for people to visualise how all the gears fit together.

Capistrano is a system for *intermediate-to-advanced programmers* to execute commands in a structured, repeatable way on one or more remote machines.

*It is incidentally pre-configured for deploying Ruby Rails applications*; However people are successfully deploying PHP, Python, Haskell and Erlang systems with it, not to mention static sites. Capistrano is also suitable for server administration. Software such as ["Paukul's Xool":http://github.com/paukul/zool] (designed for Unix user key management) are built around our framework.

Successful use of Capistrano depends on a working knowledge of:

* SSH (With configured ["SSH Keys":using-ssh-keys])
* Ruby 
* Rake (in, that we follow their structure of [[task definitions]])
* Source control software

*Next:* ["Getting Started":2.x-Getting-Started]
